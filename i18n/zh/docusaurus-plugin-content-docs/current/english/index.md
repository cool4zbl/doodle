# Why

你可能已经知道，我刚从中国搬到了荷兰。这是我第一次在国外工作，也是第一次在完完全全沉浸式的英语环境中工作。

这是个很好的机会，整个事情也非常激动人心，但就我目前的英语水平根本做不到和外国友人们谈笑风生，有时候还会因为听不懂说不出来而非常尴尬。所以把英语学好，对当下的我来说，是一件比较紧急的事情。我需要尽快提高我的英语水平，以便能够更好地融入这个新的环境。

所以，我决定采用 [The Ultimate Guide To Improve Your English In 30 Days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NacMkOzo2J8&ab_channel=SpeakEnglishWithTiffani)
中提到的方法来学习英语。

我会维护三本日记 ——“Vocabulary”、“Study Notes”和 “Essay
Writing”，它们将帮助我提高词汇、阅读、听力和写作等技能。我希望我可以每天更新这些本子，通过这种方式，最终能够系统地提升我的英语水平。

As you might already know, I'm a software engineer who recently relocated from China to the Netherlands. This marks my
first experience working abroad and also my first venture into a fully immersive English-speaking environment.
This opportunity is thrilling, yet the reality is that my current proficiency in English falls short of effortlessly
engaging light-hearted banter with my foreign friends. Occasionally, this language barrier even leads to embarrassing
moments when I struggle to understand or express myself adequately.

Thus, enhancing my English skills swiftly has become an urgent priority for me, vital to better assimilating into this
new
setting.

To address this, I've chosen to follow the strategies outlined
in [The Ultimate Guide To Improve Your English In 30 Days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NacMkOzo2J8&ab_channel=SpeakEnglishWithTiffani).
This approach seems promising for elevating my command of the language, and I'm excited to get started.

In line with this, I plan to maintain three dedicated journals — "Vocabulary", "Study Notes", and "Essay Writing". These
will serve as a pivotal tool in argumenting my capabilities in vocabulary, reading, listening, and writing. I intend to
update these journals daily, fostering a disciplined and systematic approach steadily advance my English language
skills.
