Hello, I started writing again.

This time, I used [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), and it feels pretty good. 

This website belongs to me. I hope I can continue to ponder and summarize since I believe it is a good habit.

## Goal
So I want to accomplish the following:

- organize my knowledge and keep track of what I've lately learned;
- experiment with new productivity strategies, stay motivated and avoid burnout;
- improve my English(as a non-native English speaker);
- become more self-disciplined so that I have more time for the activities listed above.

## Topic
While I have a few ideas for new blog posts in mind, I don't want to limit myself to just technical topics. Instead, I will probably touch on different areas of my interest, such as:

- full-stack technical topics related to the technologies I use (Go, React.js, JavaScript/TypeScript, gRPC, distributed systems...)
- personal projects announcements
- personal growth (i.e. soft skills),
- open source I enjoyed
- cool projects and apps I stumbled upon
- productivity / tools
- beautiful photos I shot
- music ...

Yes, that's a lot to share, let's see how it goes.


## Closing words
If you got to this point, then congratulations.
Welcome to my blog. ðŸ˜„
