# Motivations

- "Be motivated, be bold, be brave, be you."

- “Leap, and the net will appear.”

- “Always ask for the opportunity. Always ask if you want something. And when you’re offered an opportunity, always say yes. And then lastly, practise a growth mindset.”

- "Promise me you'll always remember: You're braver than you believe, and stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think."
