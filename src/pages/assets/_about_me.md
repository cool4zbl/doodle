# Greetings, Explorer! 👋

Hello! I'm Binliu, and this is my space where I dive deep into the unknown waters of
software engineering, personal growth, and life's myriad adventures.

## A Bit About Me...

I'm a [software engineer](https://github.com/cool4zbl) with over 8 years of experience, specializing in large-scale web
development.

I'm originally from China, but I'm now living in the Netherlands.

Currently, I'm weaving magic by creating a platform that integrates diverse apps using the _microservices/SingleSPA_
architecture.
Alongside, I'm on a continuous journey, exploring the enigmatic depths of _algorithms_ and _distributed systems_.

I'm a tool aficionado, always on the hunt for productivity hacks. When it comes to my editor, I swear by Vimer!

While this space is my personal blog, it's more than a reflection of my personal voyage.
I share insights on self-belief, continuous self-improvement, and my musings on the ever-evolving world of software.

## My Philosophy

I cherish the spirit of exploration and learning.

I cherish intuition and creativity.

Aha! moment is my favorite moment.

I'm a big fan of Steve Jobs, and I live by his words:
_Stay hungry; stay foolish._

My transition from Electrical Engineering to Computer Science as a self-taught software engineer mirrors the sentiments
shared by Julia Evans

> I have one main opinion about programming, which is that deeply understanding the underlying systems you use (the

> is essential if you want to do technically innovative work and be able to solve hard problems.
