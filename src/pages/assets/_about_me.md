Hi There

This is Binliu!

I write back-end applications in Go and modern front-ends using TypeScript (React.js).

I am a highly motivated and
passionate software engineer. You'll mostly find me working with
JavaScript on both client and server side. I strive to build web
applications and libraries that countless people will find
useful.
