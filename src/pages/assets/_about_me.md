# Greetings, Explorer! 👋

Hello!
I'm Binliu, and this is my digital space where I dive deep into the unknown waters of
software engineering, personal growth, and life's myriad adventures.

## A Bit About Me...

I'm a [software engineer](https://github.com/cool4zbl) with over 8 years of experience, specializing in large-scale web
development.

I'm originally from China, but I'm now living in the Netherlands.

Currently, I'm weaving magic by creating a platform that integrates diverse apps using the microservices/SingleSPA
architecture.
Alongside, I'm on a continuous journey, exploring the enigmatic depths of **algorithms** and **distributed systems**.

I'm a tool aficionado, always on the hunt for productivity hacks. When it comes to my editor, I swear by Vimer!

While this space is my personal blog, it's more than a reflection of my personal voyage.
I share insights on self-belief, continuous self-improvement, and my musings on the ever-evolving world of software.

## My Philosophy

I'm a big fan of Steve Jobs, and I live by his words:
_Stay hungry; stay foolish._

My transition from Electrical Engineering to Computer Science as a self-taught software engineer mirrors the sentiments
shared by Julia Evans

> I have one main opinion about programming, which is that deeply understanding the underlying systems you use (the
> browser, the kernel, the operating system, the network layers, your database, HTTP, whatever you’re running on top of)
> is essential if you want to do technically innovative work and be able to solve hard problems.

## Life Beyond Code...

- 👩‍🎤 Getting lost in melodies (_Rock / LoFi / Alternative / Electronic / ..._)
- 🎮 Breaking a sweat with my Switch
- 📚 Immersing myself in [books](./bookshelf)
- 🍳 Whipping up culinary delights
- 🚴‍♀️‍️ Biking through the scenic routes of the Netherlands
