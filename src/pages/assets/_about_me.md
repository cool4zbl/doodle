# 👋 Hey, I'm Binliu!

This is my space where I dive deep into the unknown waters of
software engineering, personal growth, and life's myriad adventures.

## A Bit About Me...

I'm a [software engineer](https://github.com/cool4zbl) with multiple years of experience, specializing in large-scale
web
development.

I'm originally from China, but I'm now [living in the Netherlands](./blog/restart-life-abroad-at-30).

I write code at day, and read books at night.

Alongside, I'm on a continuous journey, exploring the enigmatic depths of _algorithms_ and _distributed systems_.

I'm a tool aficionado, always on the hunt for productivity hacks. When it comes to my editor, I swear by Vimer!

## My Philosophy

I cherish the spirit of exploration and learning, and I cherish intuition and creativity.

The "Aha!" moment is my favorite!

I'm a big fan of Steve Jobs, and I live by his words: _Stay hungry; stay foolish._

## My Journey

I always fascinated by the computer world. And my journey of a self-taught software engineer mirrors the sentiments
shared by Julia Evans:

> I have one main opinion about programming, which is that deeply understanding the underlying systems you use (the
> browser, the kernel, the operating system, the network layers, your database, HTTP, whatever you’re running on top of)
> is essential if you want to do technically innovative work and be able to solve hard problems.

Same as me, I always resist being defined by tags like "you’re FE," or "you’re BE," which suggest you shouldn’t step
outside your comfort zone.

I’m not that kind of person; I always want to figure out the underlying things, the principles underneath the interface.
I love to dive deep into the underlying systems and understand how things work under the hood.

That’s why I taught myself web development before graduation, even though my major was Electronic Engineering. I was
amazed by the web (okay, hardware is hard...) and became a front-end developer after graduation.

In my first job at [Douban](https://www.douban.com/), I not
only developed technical skills but also learned the spirit of craftsmanship because what you change will have impact on
the experience of thousands of millions of users, so you must awe when shipping to production.

Then, in my job at AntGroup, I worked on building an A/B Testing platform. Statistics and probability are amazing; "If
you cannot measure it, how can you improve it?" I learned not only the theory but also some data engineering skills,
like how to build a data platform and data pipelines, etc.

But I didn’t stop there; after around 5 years in front-end/full-stack roles, upon
joining [Grab](https://www.grab.com/sg/), I transitioned to a
backend
engineer. The most significant difference between FE and BE is that you switch your perspective on the world. The
technology and the theory are also different.
I just found the more deep I dive into the underlying world, the more I love it.
distributed systems, algorithms, Go, databases, cloud services, etc.
I was amazed by all these things, and I learned a lot.
Eventually, I learned to build scalable, reliable, and high-performance systems to serve map data to millions of users.

Now, I'm learning how to build a platform that integrates diverse apps using the micro-frontend architecture utilizing
SingleSPA
and Kotlin (oh, new language, new world).

So, stay hungry, stay foolish, and keep learning.
