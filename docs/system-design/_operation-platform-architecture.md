# Operation Platform Architecture

I've been design / developing some operational platform for recent years. 

The more I develop it, the more sense I got into it. 

So I spend some time thinking about the products and strategy for my org as part of my day-to-day work.


Not everyone has the opportunity to contribute to more customer-centric tool/application, many engineers are developing internals. 



## Product Mindset


### Different users
Our customers are other engineers at the company.
Internal platforms give a way to “hide” big parts of technical complexity and decrease the cognitive load of a developer.

Platform teams also need in-depth technical knowledge of infrastructure, automation and security topics. 
This knowledge is a critical part of building a well-orchestrated internal platform.
