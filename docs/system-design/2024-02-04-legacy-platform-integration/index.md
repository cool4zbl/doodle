# Legacy Platform Integration

## Overview

We are building a new operational platform to replace the legacy platform, the legacy platform has been built for a
while. It's a monolithic application that's been built up over
the years. It's a bit of a mess, but it's also a critical part of our business. We need to integrate it with our new
platform.

## Goals

- **Seamless Integration**: The integration should be seamless for the end user. They shouldn't notice any difference in
  the way they use the platform.
- **Maintainability**: The integration should be easy to maintain. We don't want to introduce new problems while solving
  this one.
- **Performance**: The integration should be performant. We don't want to slow down the new platform.
- **Cost-Effective**: The integration should be cost-effective. We don't want to spend a fortune on this.
- **Documentation**: The integration should be well-documented. We want to make sure that future developers can
  understand how it works.
- **Compliance**: The integration should comply with all relevant regulations and standards.
- **User Experience**: The integration should provide a good user experience. We don't want to frustrate our users.
- **Flexibility**: The integration should be flexible. We want to be able to make changes and improvements in the
  future.
- **Dependencies**: The integration should have minimal dependencies. We don't want to introduce new dependencies that
  could cause problems.
- **Error Handling**: The integration should handle errors gracefully. We don't want to expose users to cryptic error
  messages.
- **Customization**: The integration should allow for customization. We want to be able to tailor it to our specific
  needs.
