# From Internal Operation Platform to Internal Platform

I've been design / developing some internal platform for recent years, many of them are for our operators and developers
at the company.
Internal platforms give a way to “hide” big parts of technical complexity and decrease the cognitive load of a
developer.

The more I develop it, the more sense I got into it.

So I spend some time thinking about the products and strategy for my org as part of my day-to-day work.

## Internal Operation Platform Architecture

Below is the architecture of an internal operation platform.

platform.

## Dilemma and Challenges
## Product Mindset
Our customers are other engineers at the company.
Not everyone has the opportunity to contribute to more customer-centric tool/application, many engineers are developing
internals.
Platform teams also need in-depth technical knowledge of infrastructure, automation and security topics. This knowledge
is a critical part of building a well-orchestrated internal platform.

> Focus should be empowering technical teams instead of building tools for problems which are solved already.
