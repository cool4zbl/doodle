# Why having this?

As you might already know, I'm a software engineer who recently relocated from China to the Netherlands. This marks my
first experience working abroad and also my first venture into a fully immersive English-speaking environment.
This opportunity is thrilling, yet the reality is that my current proficiency in English falls short of effortlessly
engaging light-hearted banter with my foreign friends. Occasionally, this language barrier even leads to embarrassing
moments when I struggle to understand or express myself adequately.

Thus, enhancing my English skills swiftly has become an urgent priority for me, vital to better assimilating into this
new
setting.

To address this, I've chosen to follow the strategies outlined
in [The Ultimate Guide To Improve Your English In 30 Days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NacMkOzo2J8&ab_channel=SpeakEnglishWithTiffani).
This approach seems promising for elevating my command of the language, and I'm excited to get started.

In line with this, I plan to maintain three dedicated journals â€” "Vocabulary", "Study Notes", and "Essay Writing". These
will serve as a pivotal tool in argumenting my capabilities in vocabulary, reading, listening, and writing. I intend to
update these journals daily, fostering a disciplined and systematic approach steadily advance my English language
skills.
