# Why having this?

As you may have known, I'm a software engineer who just relocated from China to the Netherlands. This is my first time
working abroad, and my first time working in a fully immersive English environment.

But my original English level is not that good, so learning English is actually an emergent thing for me. I need to
improve my English level as soon as possible so that I can better integrate into this environment. This is actually a
good opportunity.

Here, I decided to use the method mentioned
in [The Ultimate Guide To Improve Your English In 30 Days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NacMkOzo2J8&ab_channel=SpeakEnglishWithTiffani)
to learn English.

I will maintain 3 journals -- "vocabulary", "study notes", "essay writing", which will help me improve my vocabulary,
reading,
listening, writing. I hope to update these journals daily, as a systematic way to enhance my English proficiency.
